# Kahidlaw

A Capstone/Thesis Project we made by having the theme of Philippine History but, made it in a gamified way. Primarily, it tackles the actual events that happened in it's different eras in Pre-Colonial, Spanish, Japanese-American, and Martial-Law Era.

If you ever want to try our game here's the google drive [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zHe4ejT1DaI2hcxiw22o_peG-k-uGT8T?usp=sharing) for this.

This was created for 8 months long and used Unity, C#, and Firebase to create this product.
We also thank you Liberated Pixel Cup (LPC) for your amazing sprites and Uppbeat for background musics and sound effects!.
