# Kahidlaw

A Capstone/Thesis Project we made by having the theme of Philippine History but, made it in a gamified way. Primarily, it tackles the actual events that happened in it's different eras in Pre-Colonial, Spanish, Japanese-American, and Martial-Law Era.

This was created for 8 months long and used Unity, C#, and Firebase to create this product.

We also thank you Liberated Pixel Cup (LPC) for your amazing sprites and Uppbeat for background musics and sound effects!.

This project was really hard and I really thank my groupmates that made it possible!
